I have often been asked, which was the more important to the world, pure or applied science. To have the applications of a science, the science itself must exist. Should we stop its progress, and attend only to its applications, we should soon degenerate into a people like the Chinese, who have made no progress for generations, because they have been satisfied with the applications of science, and have never. sought for reasons in what they have done. The reasons constitute pure science. They have known the application of gunpowder for centuries; and yet the reasons for its peculiar action, if sought in the proper manner, would have developed the science of chemistry, and even of physics, with all their numerous applications. By contenting themselves with the fact that gunpowder will explode, and seeking no farther, they have fallen behind in the progress of the world; and we now regard this oldest and most numerous of nations as only barbarians.

我时常被问及这样的问题：纯科学与应用科学究竟哪个对世界更重要。为了应用科学，科学本身必须存在。假如我们停止科学的进步而只留意科学的应用，我们很快就会退化成中国人那样，多少代人以来他们（在科学上）都没有什么进步，因为他们只满足于科学的应用，却从来没有追问过他们所做事情中的原理。这些原理就构成了纯科学。中国人知道火药的应用已经若干世纪，如果他们用正确的方法探索其特殊应用的原理，他们就会在获得众多应用的同时发展出化学，甚至物理学。因为只满足于火药能爆炸的事实，而没有寻根问底，中国人已经远远落后于世界的进步。我们现在只是将这个所有民族中最古老、人口最多的民族当成野蛮人。
