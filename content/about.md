> What about me?  

As a PhD candidate specializing in robot systems, my passion lies in fundalmental aspects in robotics. 
Previously, I worked as a robot algorithm engineer, where I designed navigation and localization systems for bipedal robots and automowers.

> Education

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Robot Systems at Beihang University, also known as BUAA. In 2017, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology. Subsequently, I pursued a Master's degree with the Robot Navigation and Visual SLAM team in BAICIRS (Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Intelligent Robots and Systems) at the same institute.

> Work Experience

**[Segway Robotics](http://www.segwayrobotics.com/)**(full-time, 2021-11 ~ 2022~7)

As one of the primary developers, I developed and maintained the navigation system for a mower robot, which includes several functions such as coverage mowing, boundary-follow mowing, obstacle avoidance, and trap recovery. In addition, I developed a log replay program that enables the conversion of texts to videos, aiding in the debugging process. Additionally, I provide technical guidance and support to interns and junior employees.

**[UBTECH](https://www.ubtrobot.com)**(full-time, 2019.7 ~ 2021-11)

As a designer and developer, I successfully created the navigation and landmark-based localization system for Walker in RoboCup 2021. Furthermore, I worked as a teacher assistant with Tsinghua Hephaestus, the third-place winner in RoboCup 2019. In addition to basic functions, I also developed a real-time wireless monitoring system that interacts with the robot and is based on motion capture devices, ROS, and WiFi.
